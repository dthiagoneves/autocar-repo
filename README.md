# autocar-repo
An autonomous car simulation project for the course of Decentralized Control of Complex Systems

The main goal is to build a set of streets with obstacles such as people crossing, lights and other cars and to determine a trajectory to be followed by the autonomous car. The methods used in this simulation are based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC).

The application will be built in Python with the Pyomo library for the MPC methods.
